Quick Search is a browser extension that allows users to quickly navigate to their favorite websites using predefined shortcuts. It saves time and makes everyday browsing more convenient.

How does it work?

Redirecting to a website using shortcuts:

Type the activation shortcut (e.g., qq) into the browser's search bar and press space.
Enter the predefined website shortcut (e.g., yt for YouTube) and press Enter.
Searching with shortcuts:

Type the activation shortcut (e.g., qq) and press space.
Use the search mode by entering !shortcut (e.g., !yt) followed by the search phrase.
Press Enter to go to the search results.
Users can also add new shortcuts and manage existing ones through the settings panel.
